<h1 style="font-size:400%">Bubble sort</h1>
<br>
<p>Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  <br>The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.</p>
<b>
<p>This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational tool.<br>
  More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.
</p>
<b>
<p> Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of an algorithm, or a sorting algorithm, to introductory computer science students.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort"><sup>2</sup><p/></a>
